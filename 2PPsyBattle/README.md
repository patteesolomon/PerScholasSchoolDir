2 Player Psychic Battle

Introduction -

Player Psychic Battle is a battle system that
integrates together the elements of ATB and new elements
together.

Its purpose is to create a system that enables the usage of
a moderate level of RPG gameplay mechanics that give both players
the newer feel of the old and the even newer psionics mechanics to be added.

This is something of a magic system. In that light, it can
also be seen as something of a similar mechanic to a familiar board game that I am not at the freedom to use in this work due to a lack of memory and copyright law.

For the evaluation of the polar mechanic used in the psionic
balancing system, I used a median pole, a positive pole, and a negative pole. The purpose for these poles is born from the idea
and necessity for keeping not only the game fair but the player
feeling less involved with said "magic" system.

    This system is promising what exactly? -

There is no promise; just two poles are used as measuring poles.
a median point that pushes the ball toward the center for greater balance and a confidence boost for the player. This boost is necessary so that he or she (insert pronoun here) could control the fight any way desired while also, at several points in the fight, playing on their luck to keep up with the battle pace. Suffice to say the mechanics and their definitions, as well as their purpose, are defined here:

    The Positive Pole: This pole is what gives the positive polarity of the psionic abilities presented, and said abilities are dependent on this pole. The more the positive pole is used, the more positive energy it carries. Within the battle itself, abilities of the "healing" or "supportive" type are typically used. These abilities can also misdirectly target the opposing force as well as their user, given the nurturing behavior of positivity being merely emulated in gameplay.

    The Negative Pole: This pole is what gives the negative abilities their voracity, just as the Positive Pole gives them the intense fervor needed as that pole goes further in its opposed direction. This pole is no different in that, but completely different in the spectrum of abilities it amplifies.
    The amplification of "offensive," "chaotic," or even "violent" psionic attacks can be seen as devastating or disorienting to both the combatants opposed and the psychic user.

    The Median Point: This is not any type of pole. It is a specific kind of point plotted in between the positive and negative poles. It exists to sit in between and keep the user in mind for when it goes too far over the positive or negative poles so that these poles don't allow for the user to become so overburdened with psionic energy that their usage renders them disabled or dead from overexertion. In this emulation of this aspect, the user, a "player," so to speak, dies if the previously stated psionic strain occurs. The negative pole cannot go over this point in the positive direction or vice versa. Neither the positive nor the negative pole goes over this point in the negative direction.

    Psionic Overexersion: An aspect of psionic abilities being abused when a human being uses their abilities to supress or aid their environment and other humans to a degree that can be even seen as (pos) overzealous, needy, or (neg) overindulgent or greedy. This aspect is emulated in the battle system so that the balancing aspect of needing to stay alive while hoping that the randomizer doesn't result in the player's favor keeps said player from abusing psionics in-game.

    Ether: An energy-like matter that is shaped by what many believe to be a type of fictitious energy that only exists as an exotic waveform that can emulate different aspects of reality and even instigate it. All within the realm of fiction, of course. As of the time this is being written, this type of exotic energy is not real in any sense of the current state of scientific development. There is no real evidence of this type of energy. This aspect is merely here for the purpose of creating a consumption aspect for the player so that the game doesn't overextend what is only given. which is little and needs to be cultivated through other areas of combat. Ether is obtained from physical and non-psionic gunfire combat and is needed for all psionic abilities acquired within this simulation.

This concludes this explanation of what these mechanics are within the ATB or any potential turn-based battle system, as these mechanics would need to be greatly re-engineered to a more comparable degree in any other game system that implements a combat mode or mechanic.
